  Who are we?

  To date roughly #{community.total} people have attended #wd42 and became a part of our community of Tasmanian Web Developers. Of these the #{community.speakers.length} listed below have prepared and presented fantastic talks targeted at pushing boundaries and expanding the combined knowledge of our community. Without the continued support of the community, Web Developer 42Â° would be nothing.
