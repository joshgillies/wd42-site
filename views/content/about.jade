  Since it's inception Web Developer 42° has sought out to become the premier web developer centric meetup in Tasmania. Providing a friendly, open and inviting setting to empower and encourage the emerging number of talented Tasmanian web professionals.

p.
  Web Developer 42° acts not only a central point for the community to gather and geek out, but also as a platform for those wanting to take on the national or global stage. Some speakers share valuable experience talking about methods and technologies they use - whilst having the opportunity to hone their presentation skills. While others present their ideas and gain honest, comprehensive feedback on their projects - something that all budding entrepreneurs is worth its weight in gold.

p.
  So if this sounds like something you'd be into, please come along to our next meetup and share with us some of the incredible experiences that come from being a part of a community as passionate about their trade as ours.

p.
  Oh and best of all, Web Developer 42° is completely free to attend!
