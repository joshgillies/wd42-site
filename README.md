# Web Developer 42°
All aboard the fun train.

## Development
The Web Developer 42° site is built with Node.js at it's core and as such a working Node.js install
is required before you can do anything with the code in this repository.


### Getting started
From within the root of your local copy of this repository, you'll need to fetch all module dependencies
for this application to run. 

Fortunately in Node.js this is as simple as performing the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Once npm has retrieved all app dependencies, you can start the app by performing the following:

```bash
$ node app.js
```

This command will return the web address and port the application is running on.

Happy days!
